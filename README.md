GroupmeLocator
==============

This is an Android Application for tracking yourself and posting location updates to a chat program called Groupme.  

It was made as a fun side project to learn both GPS applications as well as persistent applications (which turned out
to be the Alarm Manager in this case, after some trial and error) as well as using the built-in SQL database.

Please see the wiki for screenshots and descriptions.
